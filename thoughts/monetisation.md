# Monetisation

As this service will require hardware, moderation and support, we will also
require money. As soon as money comes into play, things get more
complicated and we'll also need people that handle marketing, finances and
whatever else is required, which in turn means we need even more money.

What follows is a perspective on possible monetisation concepts.

## Advertisements

Advertisements are a very common way of income for social media platforms.
A downside of advertisements is, that they often have privacy impacts, since
in order to show relevant ads, you'll require a user profile.

Therefore, if we'll have ads, they won't be personalised and therefore we also
can't demand that much money from companies interested advertising on our
platform.

Additonally, some users might be annoyed by ads. Therefore, if we have other
means of monetisations, that are as effective or more effective, we'll prefer
not using ads. An option would be, to optionally offer the user to see ads in
return for extra-features, such as being able to boost one of your posts each
two weeks.
