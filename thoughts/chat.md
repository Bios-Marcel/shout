# Chat

* Name chats "whispers"
* Main goal should be to reduce data sent and ensure peak-performance, especially when users have metered connections
* E2E-encrypted
  * Chats aren't stored on server, only as long as not received
* Pinnable
* Taggable
* Chat rename
* Deletable
  * Cached chats are deleted upon reconnect
* Allow sending audio, images and video

## Group Chats

In order to avoid an early switch to other platforms, such as Telegram, Signal
or WhatsApp, we need group chats. The goal here is not to keep users on our
platform for as long as possible, as chats only cause direct costs and don't
provide us any data or money.

* E2E encrypted as well
* Allow sending out invite links
