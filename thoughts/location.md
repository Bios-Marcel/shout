# Location

* Locations aren't exact
  > We truncate those down to pre-defined squares the size of 3-4mÂ². This has
  > the upside of preventing us from making exact location profiles or being
  > forced to give out data to authorities or lose them to bad actors.
* Exact locations can be shared via chat
  * Just like chats, these will be encrypted
