# In-App Statistics

In Jodel, you don't really know how many active users there are or in which
regions of your city the usage is high or low.

Therefore, having the following datapoints would be interesting:

* Per city
  * Registered users
  * Active users
  * Active posting users
* Proximity
  * Active users
  * Active posting users

A problem with proximity statistics might be a high computation cost.
