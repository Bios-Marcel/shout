# Transparency

Anything that happens on the platform should be visible to the users.
Meaning you'll always be able to have insights regarding upvotes, downvotes and reports.
This way you can see how your own behaviour affects your Resonance and therefore your freedom
and capabilities on the platform.

This also goes for decisions made by the automated punishment system. You'll be informed of
punishments and be able to see why a punishment has gone into effect.

Every user should at any point in time have the option to download or delete ALL their data.
This includes all posts, replies, chats and other data related directly to the users account.
