# Healthy Behaviours

* Allow specifying sleeping time
  > The app will give a visual warning that suggests turning off the app.
* Warn after N hours in app
  > The app will try to prevent addictive behaviours. As the app will also not
  > be heavily focused on advertisements and not collect any useful data that
  > is generated during usage, we'll not even lose much from this.
  > *This can be turned off, maybe even on first use of the app*
* Recommend breaks every X time units
  > It's generally healthy to not sit / lay around and look at your phone for
  > hours on end. Therefore it'd be nice to nudge the uer here.
  > *This can be turned off, maybe even on first use of the app*
* Inform about healthy discussion culture
  > This has to be done rather passively, so it doesn't anger or annoy the user.
  > A more concrete concept is required here.
* Inform about what toxicity is and how other people might react to it
  > People are generally not very understanding and tollerant, which often
  > leads to toxic behaviours. It'd be nice to automatically detect such
  > behaviours and give out tips / warnings. Note that this isn't automatic
  > blocking of content. Additionlly, we should provide more in-depth content
  > for people that actually want to read up on this.
