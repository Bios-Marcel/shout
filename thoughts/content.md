### Channel

A channel is a named feed of posts.

* Global and geo-dependent channels
  > Some topics might generally be interesting and some things, such as meetups, might only be interesting locally.
* Channel discoverability
  * Add rough channel topics
    > Example:
    > The channels `tabletennis` and `gym` belong into rough channel topic `sports` .
  * Subscribe to rough topics for channel suggestions
  * Initially ask for channel interests
* A channel should only exist, after the first post has been made.
* Channel invites (via chat or an existing post)
