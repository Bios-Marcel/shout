  > For example a user that trolls a lot in @questions can't post there, but still in @main

### Pins

* Should allow categorisation

### Resonance

Just like Jodel, we will have a Resonance system. Resonance can be earned through
upvotes, lost through downvotes and spent by reporting.

Resonance will determine how the moderation system treats you.

If your Resonance is very low or you have lost lots of Resonance recently, one of
the following things might happen:

* Banned from certain types of channels (for example question posts)
* Reduced post speed (N posts or replies per M hours)
* Replies are hidden away by default
* Temporary ban from posting

In order to have any of these punishments take effect, we can either use the
overall Resonance or recent changes in Resonance balance, if any exist. An upside of
the latter would be, that users with a lot of Resonance also can't afford trolling
from time to time, using their Resonance as "troll budget".

By default, each user starts with a rather low base Resonance, but an amount bigger
than zero, in order to be able to use the reporting functionality.

### Voting

Voting is the main mechanism that changes a users Resonance. An upvote can be given
for free and will increase the posters Resonance. Downvoting will decrease the posters
Resonance, but also reduce the own Resonance, in order to prevent abuse.

### Reports

A report is kind of like a downvote, but more extreme. Attached to a report
can be a text message and a reason. Reasons might go from mild things such as
`spam` or `disResonanceive behaviour` to `exposing personal information` or
`violence`.

On Jodel, people tend to quickly report others if they are in disagreement.
In order to combat this, reporting should have a cost. The cost shouldn't be
too big, but also not insignificant.

Certain types of reports should be exempt from cost though, such as illegal content
regarding minors for example.

### Negative achievment badges

If a user does negative things, such as portray bad behaviour in physical meetups or
troll a lot, they can be reported for these things and earn a badge, marking them
as a "bad" person, visible to all other users, but not themselves. These badges
are indicators for potential dangers coming from a certain person in order to allow
users to reduce their risk when interaction with fellow users.

These badegs won't run out with time, but can get removed if users "commend" you, for
having improved your behaviour. A downside to this feature is, that if people do
report abuse, people might be flagged as "bad" even though they haven't really done
anything severe. However, a single report shouldn't be enough to get branded like this.

### Human moderators

Moderators aren't auto elected, like on Jodel. There's no community election process
either, as that's not really possible without users having an identity. Instead, Moderators
are platform internal people that act according to pre-defined rules.

If users wish to become moderators, they can apply through the app. As the service is
currently not intending to make any money, this will not give any payment though.

* Moderators for specific channels
