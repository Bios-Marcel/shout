Social media, but anonymous and geo location bound.

## Why

This project is intended to be an alternative to [Jodel](https://advertising.jodel.com/appdownload-en).
The intention is to follow its core principles. However, there are gonna be difference in terms of
moderation and monetary incentives. Additionally use third party clients will be possible and will be endorsed.

The feature set will be bigger and allow higher configurability, to allow useres to "protected" themselves
from certain things, since some people do stupid shit under the veil of anonymity.

## Repository structure

The intent behind this repository is to act as a holder for the specification, documentation, backend code
and frontend code.

## Concept

There is no written concept yet, this is just an idea I had on a whim.
Let's hope I actually implement it ;)
